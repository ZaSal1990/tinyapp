# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
This app is fully capable of storing user session cookies with ehanced data security provided by hashing. Users can create accounts, log in, create tiny URLs, edit and delete them. URL data (long or short) is stored as memomry based object which resets once server restarts.
